## How do I set up the React environment?

1.  Have `npm` installed in your system.
2.  Run `npm install` in a terminal inside the repository.
3.  Finally, once all the dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev`.
4.  The terminal will show a local address where the page is running with live changes.
