# Pokemon Battle Arena

## How do I set up the React environment?

1.  Have `npm` installed in your system.
2.  Run `npm install` in a terminal inside the repository.
3.  Finally, once all the dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev`.
4.  The terminal will show a local address where the page is running with live changes.

## What if I need a new dependency?

1. Head to the `package.json`
2. If you need the dependency on the dev environment only, add it to the `devDependencies`, however if the dependency is needed for the functioning of the app, add it to the `dependencies`.
3. Run `npm install` in a terminal inside the repository.
